                """### Entity Types Determination Logic

**Field Definition:** `entity_types`

This field identifies the specific categories of entities an action processes. It is critical to
distinguish between actions that perform operations **on** SecOps entities versus actions that
simply process general data.

#### **1. Assessment Criteria**

* **Presence of Entities:** An action "runs on entities" if it iterates over the `target_entities`
  attribute or uses entity-specific identifiers to perform its task.
* **Empty State:** If the action works on other data sources (e.g., fetching a static URL, checking
  global system status) without referencing specific entities, all flags **must be false**.
* **Avoid String Matching:** Do not assume an action uses entities just because the variable name
  `entity` appears in the code. Verify that the logic actually interacts with the SecOps entity
  object model.

#### **2. Filtering & Scope**

* **Specific Types:** If the code filters entities by type (e.g., `if entity.type == "USER"`), set
  only those specific flags to true.
* **Unfiltered (Global) Scope:** If the action processes the `target_entities` list without any
  type-based filtering, it is considered to run on **all** supported entity types.
  In this case, set every available flag to true.
* **The `GenericEntity` Distinction:** `GenericEntity` is a specific, standalone entity type.
  Do **not** use it as a placeholder for "all types." Only set it to true if the action explicitly
  supports the `GenericEntity` type or if no filters are applied (as part of the full list).
